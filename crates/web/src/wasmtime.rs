//! Browser-side support for the wasmtime runtime embedded by `starstream-run`.
//!
//! Wasmtime doesn't recognize wasm32 as a supported OS, so with the
//! `custom-virtual-memory` feature it calls out to a small C-ABI for its
//! platform needs instead of using mmap/signals directly. We satisfy that ABI
//! here, in pure Rust, backed by the global allocator — standing in for the
//! mmap/TLS facilities a real OS would provide.
//!
//! There is no real virtual memory in the sandbox, so:
//!   * "mmap" is a page-aligned, zeroed heap allocation,
//!   * "mprotect" is a no-op (Pulley bytecode is interpreted *data*, never
//!     executed as native code, so W^X is irrelevant), and
//!   * copy-on-write memory images are disabled (we return "no image").
//!
//! The `custom-fiber` stack-switching hooks (`wasmtime_fiber_init` /
//! `wasmtime_fiber_switch`) are defined analogously in [`crate::fiber`], but as
//! thin shims: a wasm32 program cannot switch its own stack, so they forward to
//! JS imports satisfied by the JSPI glue in `web/fiber-env.js`.
